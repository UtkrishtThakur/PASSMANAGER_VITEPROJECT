# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
🔐 PassOP — Password Manager
<br>
This is a simple password manager I built using Vite + React on the frontend and Express + MongoDB on the backend.
It lets you save, view, edit, and delete passwords easily — all in one place.
<br>
I also added React Toaster for alerts, so you get nice popups whenever you add or delete something.
<br>
<br>
🚀 What It Does
<br>
Add new passwords (with site, username, and password)
<br>
View all saved passwords from MongoDB
<br>
Edit or delete any saved password
<br>
Shows alerts using React Toaster (for success and error messages)
<br>
Uses a simple and clean UI built with React + Tailwind (if you used Tailwind)
<br>
